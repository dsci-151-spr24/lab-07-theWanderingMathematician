A study of conducted in Whickham, England recorded participants' age, smoking status at baseline, and then 20 years later recorded their health outcome.
In this lab we analyse the relationships between these variables, first two at a time, and then controlling for the third.

# Learning goals

-   Visualising relationships between variables
-   Discovering Simpson's paradox via visualisations

# Getting started

Go to the course GitHub organization and locate your homework repo, clone it in RStudio and open the R Markdown document.
Knit the document to make sure it compiles without errors.

## Warm up

Before we introduce the data, let's warm up with some simple exercises.
Update the YAML of your R Markdown file with your information, knit, commit, and push your changes.
Make sure to commit with a meaningful commit message.
Then, go to your repo on GitHub and confirm that your changes are visible in your Rmd **and** md files.
If anything is missing, commit and push again.

## Packages

We'll use the **tidyverse** package for much of the data wrangling and visualisation and the data lives in the **mosaicData** package.
These packages are already installed for you.
You can load them by running the following in your Console:

```{r eval = TRUE, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse) 
library(mosaicData) 
```

## Data

The dataset we'll use is called Whickham from the **mosaicData** package.
You can find out more about the dataset by inspecting their documentation, which you can access by running `?Whickham` in the Console or using the Help menu in RStudio to search for `Whickham`.

# Exercises

1.  What type of study do you think these data come from: observational or experiment?
    Why?
- *This data is from an observational study; it was taken from a survey, and surveys don't control for or change variables, they just observe them.*

2.  How many observations are in this dataset?
    What does each observation represent?
- *This dataset has `r nrow(Whickham)` rows, each of which represents a woman in Whickham who was included in the survey, and who was classified as a current smoker or as never having smoked.*

3.  How many variables are in this dataset?
    What type of variable is each?
    Display each variable using an appropriate visualization.
- *There are three variables in this dataset: two faceted variables (`outcome` and `smoker`) and one integer variable (`age`).*

```{r}
#| label: individual-variables
Whickham %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = outcome, fill = outcome)) +
  geom_bar() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#67a9cf", "#ef5a42")) +
  labs(title = "Outcome", subtitle = "Whether the subject was alive or dead 20 years after the survey", x = "", y = "") +
  theme_minimal()
Whickham %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = smoker, fill = smoker)) +
  geom_bar() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#67a9cf", "#ef5a42")) +
  labs(title = "Smoker", subtitle = "Was the subject a smoker or not at the time of the survey?", x = "", y = "") +
  theme_minimal()
Whickham %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2) +
  labs(title = "Age", subtitle = "Age of the subject at the time of the survey", x = "Age", y = "") +
  theme_minimal()
```

4.  What would you expect the relationship between smoking status and health outcome to be?

- *My initial hypothesis would be that there would be a negative correlation between smoking status and health outcome, moreso in older people.*

üß∂ ‚úÖ ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Knit, *commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message. Make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is cleared up afterwards.*

5.  Create a visualization depicting the relationship between smoking status and health outcome. Briefly describe the relationship, and evaluate whether this meets your expectations. Additionally, calculate the relevant conditional probabilities to help your narrative. Here is some code to get you started:

```{r}
#| label: smoker-data
Whickham %>%
  count(smoker, outcome) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = smoker, y = n, fill = outcome)) +
  geom_col(position = "fill") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Smoking status vs. health outcome", subtitle = "Among women in Whickham in a 1972 survey", x = "Did they smoke?", y = "", fill = "Health outcome")
smoker_count <- Whickham %>%
  count(smoker)
Whickham %>%
  group_by(smoker) %>%
  count(outcome) %>%
  full_join(smoker_count, "smoker") %>%
  mutate(prop = n.x/n.y, .keep = "unused")
```

- *The data here shows that 31% of the survey-takers who didn't smoke had died, while only 24% of those who had smoked did, contrary to our expectations of a higher proportion of mortalities among people who had smoked.*

6.  Create a new variable called `age_cat` using the following scheme:

-   `age <= 44 ~ "18-44"`
-   `age > 44 & age <= 64 ~ "45-64"`
-   `age > 64 ~ "65+"`

```{r}
#| label: age-cats
Whickham <- Whickham %>%
  mutate(age_cat = case_when(
    age <= 44 ~ "18-44",
    age > 64 ~ "65+",
    TRUE    ~ "45-64"
  ))
```

7.  Re-create the visualization depicting the relationship between smoking status and health outcome, faceted by `age_cat`. What changed? What might explain this change? Extend the contingency table from earlier by breaking it down by age category and use it to help your narrative.

```{r}
#| label: smoker-data-by-age
Whickham %>%
  count(smoker, age_cat, outcome) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = smoker, y = n, fill = outcome)) +
  geom_col(position = "fill") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Smoking status vs. health outcome", subtitle = "Among women in Whickham in a 1972 survey", x = "Did they smoke?", y = "", fill = "Health outcome") +
  facet_wrap(~ age_cat, ncol = 1)

smoker_age_count <- Whickham %>%
  count(smoker, age_cat)
Whickham %>%
  group_by(smoker, age_cat) %>%
  count(outcome) %>%
  full_join(smoker_age_count, join_by("smoker", "age_cat")) %>%
  mutate(prop = n.x/n.y, .keep = "unused")
```

- *After breaking down the data into age groups, we see that, despite the statistic seen in the previous visualisation, we now have three different distributions which show that, within each category, a higher proportion of people who had smoked died than that of people who hadn't smoked. This difference however, is much smaller than the difference between seperate categories, since older people are more likely to die of many causes. For example, the difference in mortality rates between smokers and non-smokers from 18-44 is only 1.7%, while the difference between smoking 18-44 year olds and smoking 45-64 year-olds is 27% My guess is that smoking is generally more common in younger people, and that the general difference in frequencies between the age groups end up overriding the differences due to smoking status, producing the counterintuitive result seen in the first visualisation.*

üß∂ ‚úÖ ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Knit, *commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message. Make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is cleared up afterwards and review the md document on GitHub to make sure you're happy with the final state of your work.*
